### Commands Part 2 

### ls commands along with the flag variables 

~~~
ls -a : also lists files and folders starting with . 
prints the hidden files and folders 

ls -l : lists down more details about files such as owner permissions , date etc.


ls -lh: works like ls -l but also gives size of the files 

~~~
### Creating files and folders 

~~~
mkdir : to make directories ie folders 
Exa

touch : for making files 

cat : to print the contents inside of a file 

rmdir : to delete empty folders 

rm : to delete files . You cant del folders with it ; without any other flag variables 

rm -r : to delete files recursively . 
It first goes inside the folder , deletes all the files inside and then deletes the folder recursively . 

rm -rf : just like rm -r also it forces 


~~~


### Very Important 

~~~
Never try to do Experiments involving rm and the root dir 

also 

whatever you are deleting from the terminal does not goes to the trash or recycle bin 

its just gets deleted and its pretty hard for anyone to recover that 
~~~


~~~
clear : clears the working space by actually moving you to the top of the current shell . 
just clears the whole console 

mkdir : this helps us to create a new folder 

touch <filename> : we can create a brand new blank file out of the blue 

cat <filename> : prints the whole content of the file 

rm <filename> : this command deletes a file 

rmdir <foldername> : this cmd deletes an empty folder 

rm -r <foldername> : the -r flag enables to recursively delete all the content of the folder and then delete the folder 

rm -rf <foldername> : works just like rm -r without any prompts of deletion , ie no warnings are given 


~~~

### try to use rm -rf as less as possible for your own safety
